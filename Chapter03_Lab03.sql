--3.28 Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the names and IDs of those instructors who teach every course taught in his or her department (i.e., every course that appears in the course relation with the instructorâ€™s department name). Order result by name. 
SELECT i.ID, i.name
FROM instructor i

    )
)
ORDER BY i.name;


--3.31  Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the ID and name of each instructor who has never given an A grade in any course she or he has taught. (Instructors who have never taught a course trivially satisfy this condition.) 
SELECT i.ID, i.name
FROM instructor i
